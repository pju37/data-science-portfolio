# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my data-driven projects, where I apply statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization to solve real-world problems. Each project is designed to highlight a specific skill set, from data cleaning and EDA to model deployment and storytelling through visuals.

## Projects

### **Parkinson's Disease Prediction** 
This project explores a rich synthetic dataset of 2,105 patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/parkinsons-disease-dataset-analysis). The dataset includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, medical history, clinical metrics, cognitive and functional assessments, symptoms, and diagnosis indicators. I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations across these variables, focusing on understanding which factors may be most associated with the presence of Parkinson’s. The work lays the foundation for future predictive modeling, while offering insights into how health, lifestyle, and clinical indicators interact in the context of neurological disease.
